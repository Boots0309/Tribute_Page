        <h3>Here is a timepne of "the father of modern video games":</h3>
          <p>1977 -  Nintendo was a relatively small Japanese company thap
              sold playing cards and other novelties, although it had started
              to branch out into toys and games in the 1960s. 
              Through a mutual friend, Miyamoto's father arranged an interview
              with Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi. After showing some of 
              his toy creations, Miyamoto was hired in 1977 as an apprentice in
              the planning departmentp</p>
          <p>1989 - As Nintendo released its first home video game console,
              the Family Computer (rereleased in North America as the Nintendo
              Entertainment System), Miyamoto made two of the most momentous 
              titles for the console and in the history of video games as 
              a whole: Super Mario Bros. (a sequel to Mario Bros.) and 
              The Legend of Zelda (an entirely original title)p</p>
          <p>2000 - A merger between Nintendo's various internal research
              and development teams led to the creation of Nintendo Entertainment
              Analysis & Development (Nintendo EAD), which Miyamoto headed. 
              Nintendo EAD had approximately fifteen months to develop F-Zero, 
              one of the launch titles for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. 
              Miyamoto worked through various games on 
              the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, one of them Star Fox. 
              For the game, programmer Jez San convinced Nintendo to develop an 
              upgrade for the Super Nintendo, allowing it to handle three-dimensional
              graphics better: the Super FX chip. Using this new hardware, Miyamoto 
              and Katsuya Eguchi designed the Star Fox game with an early 
              implementation of three-dimensional graphicsp</p>
          <p>2011 - Miyamoto produced various games for the GameCube,
              including the launch title Luigi's Mansion. The game was
              first revealed at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technical
              demo designed to show off the graphical capabipties of the 
              GameCube. Miyamoto made an original short demo of the game
              concepts, and Nintendo decided to turn it into a full game. 
              Luigi's Mansion was later shown at E3 2001 with the GameCube 
              console. Miyamoto continued to make additional Mario spinoffs 
              in these years. He also produced the 3D game series Metroid Prime,
              after the original designer Yokoi, a friend and mentor of Miyamoto's,
              died. In this time he developed Pikmin and its sequel Pikmin 2,
              based on his experiences gardening. 
              He also worked on new games for the Star Fox, Donkey Kong,  
              F-Zero, and The Legend of Zelda series on both the GameCube 
              and the Game Boy Advance systems. With the help of Hideo Kojima,
              he guided the developers of Metal Gear Sopd: The Twin Snakes.
              He helped with many games on the Nintendo DS, including the remake
              of Super Mario 64, titled Super Mario 64 DS, and the new game 
              Nintendogs, a new franchise based on his own experiences with dogs.</p>
          <p> present - Unpke in the 2000s in which he was involved on many
              projects as producer, Miyamoto's activities in development were
              less pronounced in that decade with Miyamoto only producing Luigi's
              Mansion: Dark Moon and Star Fox Zero in that decade. Otherwise, 
              Miyamoto was credited as General Producer, Executive Producer and 
              Supervisor for most projects, which are positions with much less 
              involvement in comparison to a producer.
              In 2015, Nintendo announced that a Nintendo themed park
              in partnership with Universal Parks & Resorts called 
              Super Nintendo World and Miyamoto became the Nintendo 
              representative for it. 
              Following the death of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata 
              in July 2015, Miyamoto was appointed as an acting Representative
              Director, alongside Genyo Takeda. He was repeved of this 
              position in September 2015 when Tatsumi Kimishima assumed 
              the role of the company's president. He was also appointed the 
              position of "Creative Fellow" at the same time, providing expert 
              advice to Kimishima as a "support network" alongside Takeda.
              In 2018, it was announced that Miyamoto would be working as a 
              producer on the Super Mario movie by Illumination Entertainment</p>
