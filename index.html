        <h3>The Most Decorated Ship of the Second World War.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>October 1936</strong> - Launched at Newport News Shipbuilding, She was the second carrier of the
              <em>Yorktown-class</em> and the sixth built for the United States Navy.
            </li>
            <li><strong>January 1942</strong> - Enterprise's Task Force 8 raided Kwajalein, Wotje,
              and Maloelap in the Marshall Islands, sinking three Japanese ships,
              damaging eight, and destroying numerous airplanes and ground facilities.
              Enterprise received only minor damage in the Japanese counterattack,
              as TF 8 retired to Pearl Harbor.
              Enterprise, now part of Task Force 16, swept the central Pacific,
              attacking enemy installations on Wake and Marcus Islands. </li>
            <li><strong>April 1942</strong> - After minor alterations and repairs at Pearl Harbor,
              Enterprise and TF 16 departed on 8 April 1942 to rendezvous with her
              sister ship Hornet and sailed west, escorting Hornet on the mission
              to launch 16 Army B-25 Mitchells in the "Doolittle Raid" on Tokyo.
              </li>
            <li><strong>June 1942</strong> - The Battle of Midway began on the morning of 4 June 1942,
              when four Japanese carriers, unaware of the presence of U.S. naval forces,
              launched attacks on Midway Island. Enterprise dive bombers
              engaged and disabled the Japanese carriers <em>Kaga</em> and <em>Akagi</em>, leaving them ablaze,
              while Yorktown aircraft also bombed the Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū, leaving her burning and dead in the water.
              Within an hour. A mixed squadron of Enterprise and Yorktown bombers, flying from Enterprise,
              disabled <em>Hiryu</em>, leaving her burning. The following day Enterprise dive bombers alone sank cruiser
              <em>Mikuma</em>. Despite losses to her aircraft squadrons,
              Enterprise came through undamaged and returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 June 1942.
            </li>
            <li><strong>July 1942</strong> - Enterprise sailed for the South Pacific, where she joined
              TF 61 to support the amphibious landings in the Solomon Islands on 8 August.
              For the next two weeks, the carrier and her planes guarded seaborne communication
              lines southwest of the Solomons. On 24 August, a strong Japanese force was discovered
              some 200 miles (300 km) north of Guadalcanal, and TF 61 sent planes to the attack.
              In the ensuing Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the light carrier <em>Ryūjō</em> was sunk,
              and the Japanese troops intended for Guadalcanal were forced back. Enterprise suffered
              most heavily of the American ships; three direct bomb hits and four near misses killed
              74, wounded 95, and inflicted serious damage on the carrier. Quick, hard work by damage
              control parties patched her up so that she was able to return to Hawaii under her own power.</li>
            <li><strong>May 1943</strong> - Admiral Chester Nimitz presented the ship with the first Presidential
              Unit citation awarded to an aircraft carrier. In the summer of 1943, with the new Essex-class
              and Independence-class carriers joining the American Pacific Fleet, Enterprise was temporarily
              relieved of duty, and on 20 July, she entered <em>Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</em> for
              a much-needed overhaul. Over the course of several months, Enterprise received an extensive
              refit, which included, among other upgrades, new anti-aircraft weapons and an anti-torpedo
              blister that significantly improved her underwater protection. This mid-war refit is also
              where her hull would be repainted in a dazzle camouflage and where she would receive her
              two iconic "6"s on her flight decks</li>
            <li><strong>November 1943</strong> - Return to Duty, Enterprise left four days later to provide close air
              support to the 27th Infantry Division landing on Makin Atoll, during the Battle of Makin,
              from 19–21 November 1943. The carrier's next operation was with the Fast Carrier Task Force
              in softening up the Marshall Islands and supporting the landings on Kwajalein,
              from 29 January-3 February 1944. Again Enterprise made aviation history, when she launched
              the first night radar bombing attack from a U.S. carrier. The twelve torpedo bombers in
              this strike achieved excellent results, accounting for nearly one-third of the 200,000 tons
              of shipping destroyed by aircraft.</li>
            <li><strong>June 1944</strong> - Battle of the Philippine Sea, Enterprise was one of four carriers of Task Group
              58.3 under the command of Rear Admiral John W. Reeves' during the largest carrier aircraft
              battle in history. For over eight hours, airmen of the United States and Imperial
              Japanese navies fought in the skies over TF 58 and the Marianas. Over the course of
              two days, a total of six American ships were damaged, and 130 planes and a total of
              76 pilots and aircrew were lost. In sharp contrast, American carrier aircraft, with
              a major assist from U.S. submarines, sank three Japanese carriers (<em>Hiyō, Shōkaku, and Taihō</em>),
              and destroyed 426 carrier aircraft, losses from which Japanese naval aviation would
              never recover. After the battle, Enterprise and her Task Group continued to provide
              air support for the invasion of <em>Saipan</em> through 5 July. She then sailed for
              Pearl Harbor and a month of rest and overhaul.</li>
            <li><strong>October 1944</strong> - Battle of Leyte Gulf, After operating west of the Palau Islands,
              Enterprise joined other units of TF 38 on 7 October and set course to the north.
              From 10–20 October, her aviators flew over Okinawa, Formosa, and the Philippines,
              blasting enemy airfields, shore installations, and shipping in preparation for the
              assault on Leyte. In the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Enterprise planes
              struck all three groups of enemy forces, battering battleships and destroyers
              before the action ended. The carrier remained on patrol east of Samar and Leyte
              until the end of October, then retired to Ulithi for supplies. During November,
              her aircraft struck targets in the Manila area, and at the island of Yap. </li>
